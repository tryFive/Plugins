- Basic understanding of React (optional but recommended).

## Types of Plugins

1. **Custom Fields**: Simple display types for forms.
2. **Custom Editors**: UI elements that expand into a dialog for more screen space.
3. **Custom Forms**: A blank canvas type, not confined to a specific field on your form.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-name>
3. **Install Dependencies**:
